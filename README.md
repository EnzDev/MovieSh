# MovieSh

> This was a school project to get my hand into Java Android. This does not reflect my current Java/Android/Kotlin skills.

This Android app uses TheMovieDB API to fetch movies with their cover and informations.   
The objectives were :
 - Using the FAB to do nice things
 - Have a proper Activities flow
 - Make lazy loading and do background network operations
 - hHve a nice interface
